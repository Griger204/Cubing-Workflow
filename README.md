# Cubing-Workflow
A repo to show off my learning and improvements of using algorithms and solving Rubik's cubes

## My first thoughts
<p>
I am familiar with solving the pyraminx so I do have some experience to get me started with this easily. However, there is always room for improvement , so I will use this reporitory to track my journey of getting better and faster. I will use various videos and "timer websites" to  learn, explore and keep track of my times as I do my attempts. As I move along this project, I will record everything here.
