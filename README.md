# Cubing-Workflow
A repo to show off my learning and improvements of using algorithms and solving Rubik's cubes

## My first thoughts
<p>
I am familiar with solving the pyraminx so I do have some experience to get me started with this easily. However, there is always room for improvement , so I will use this repository to track my journey of getting better and faster. I will use various videos and "timer websites" to  learn, explore, and keep track of my times as I do my attempts. As I move along this project, I will record everything here.

## What I'm solving:

<p>
The Pyraminx, also known as the triangle Rubik's Cube is a tetrahedron-shaped 3-layered twisty puzzle, having four triangular faces which are all divided into nine identical smaller triangles. This is the second best selling puzzle toy in the World after the Rubik's Cube with over 100 million pieces sold.

Solving wise, the notations are pretty much the same as a rubik's cube only that there are less that you need because it's pretty limiting and all in all, easier to solve. Here is an example of some of the notations and turns:

## First Solve
My very first solve surprised me. With a very good scrambling, I manged to solve the cube in one of the fastest times I've solved it since I started practicing.

 ## Second Solve
My second solve took a couple seconds longer than the first because I accidentaly made a wrong turn. Nonetheless, I managed to undo it still, with a very good time.

 ## Third Solve
With almost a 10s difference between my first and last solve, I solved the pyraminx in _40 seconds_! After my second attempt, I knew I needed some more practice so I took 20 minutes to go over my technique before I did my "official" timing.

 ## Post-solving thoughts
 <p>
To sum up my trials, I improved a lot! This prossess took quiet a bit of time mainly due to practicing. Beating or matching this time isn't going to be easy but with more practice and engagement, I can make 40s a <b>bad</b> solve.
